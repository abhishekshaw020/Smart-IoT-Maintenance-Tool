# Smart-IoT-Maintenance-Tool: https://iothealthpredictor.streamlit.app/
 This project leverages machine learning to predict potential failures in IoT devices based on sensor readings. Users can upload their datasets in CSV format to explore the underlying data through interactive visualizations and statistical summaries. The application utilizes a Random Forest classifier to analyze temperature, vibration, and pressure data, providing real-time predictions of device failures. With user-friendly inputs and insightful EDA features, this tool not only aids in proactive maintenance decisions but also enhances overall operational efficiency in IoT systems.
